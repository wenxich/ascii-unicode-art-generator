# ASCII/Unicode Art Generator

Experimenting with p5.js's library - implemented an ASCII/Unicode art generator with thanks to The Coding Train!

Added an upload feature, allowed users to implement their own density mappings / choose the direction of their mapping, and made both a text and image version of the art available to save. For the image version, I also added different resolution options for the saveable image.
